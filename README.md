# World_Weather_Analysis

## Challenge Overview

### Purpose:

   The purpose of the World Weather Analysis is to improve the PlanMyTrip app to the next level by adding the weather description to the weather data which was recommended by Beta Testers. This will allow the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will be able to choose any cities to create a travel itinerary, then the app will create a travel route and a marker layer map between those cities for the users to assist them.
